## What Is It?
MindTrack was a project borne out of the mental health crisis that we are currently facing, one that has only been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
It allows people to sign up and keep tracking of their daily mental health using a chatbot whilst incorporating small useful features such as to-do lists, mental health resources,
and an appointment scheduler connected to your personal calendar. It also connects them with community mental health programs and free therapy. With consistent use, users can also see their personalized mental health summary to keep track of improvements
or decreases in mental health.  

## Demo
The project is currently deployed at [MindTrack](https://mind-track.000webhostapp.com/index.html)
